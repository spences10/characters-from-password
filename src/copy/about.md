## Passwords are important

Passwords are also flawed! I like to use strong passwords, "[correct
battery horse staple]" ftw! (not really don't use this as a pasword
please!)

It can also be frustrating counting out characters 18, 7 and 12 from a
password if the site uses [masked passwords].

This was made for just that reason, paste or type in your password
then pick out the character you need.
