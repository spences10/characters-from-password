# Get character from password

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/spences10/characters-from-password.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I use strong passwords, "correct battery horse staple" ftw!

But I also get quite annoyed counting out my password onto my fingers when prompted to give characters 18, 7 and 12 from my password.

I put this together for just that, paste or type in your password then pick out your character you need.
