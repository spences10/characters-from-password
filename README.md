# Get character from password

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/spences10/characters-from-password.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I use strong passwords, ["correct battery horse staple"] ftw!

But I also get quite annoyed counting out my password onto my fingers
when prompted to give characters 18, 7 and 12 from my password.

I put this together for just that, paste or type in your password then
pick out your character you need.
